The large-scale cartoons, representing the four elements, were acquired in 1910 as the work of the famous British Pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-1882). This attribution was based on the spurious monogram ""D.G.R"" inscribed at the lower edge of each of the drawings.

Finally, in December 2015, exactly 105 years (almost to the day) after the drawings were given to the museum, the identity of the artist has been recovered. They are the work of the British artist Frederick G. Smith. It was Peter Cormack, the noted scholar of British and American stained glass, who tracked down the artist and also identified the project for which they were produced, the grand staircase at Avery Hill, in southeast London. Smith was a partner of the London firm Campbell, Smith, & Co., and he likely executed these cartoons between 1888 or 1889 when the house was being reconstructed by Colonel John T. North. The stained glass was completed by 1890, but  Avery Hill was badly damaged during the Blitz of World War II. In 1982 the museum acquired a stained glass panel directly related to the series, representing the allegory of Water (81.92). The provenance is not known, but the glass is roughly half the size of the drawing.

(24.4 x 99.5 cm),N/A,Papyrus,N/A,N/A,Public Domain,G250,"Third Intermediate Period. Fragment of the funerary papyrus of the Priest of Amon, Jekhonsefonkh: There are two scenes, both perhaps incomplete. The accompanying text is lost. A: At the right of the fragment is the god Osiris, a mummiform figure, enthroned, wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt and carrying his usual attributes, a scepter in the form of the shepherd's crook and the whip. Above is a legend of three vertical lines reading in order from right to left: ""May Osiris, Lord of Eternity, First of the Westerners (i.e. the beatified dead) grant a nysut dy hotep (funerary offerings; literally ""an offering which the king gives""). Before the god are numerous offerings, among which one may distinguish loaves of bread, a bunch of onions, a cut of meat, grapes and lotus flowers. Standing before the god and holding a jar of milk (to judge by the form of the jar--that regularly used to contain milk and used as a hieroglyph--""milk"") is the deceased, the person for whose benefit the papyrus was inscribed and decorated and in whose tomb it was preserved to modern times. His head is shorn as befitted a priest and he wears an elaborate costume of thin, white linen. Above in the legend, read from left to right: ""the wab-priest-in-front-of-Amon, Jekhonsefonkh, beatified.""
B: At the right of the left-hand scene, Jekhonsefonkh is seen again; one hand is held by a lioness-headed goddess, who turns to look into his face, his other hand is raised in the ritualistic gesture expressing adoration. The identifying legend above the priest's figure is the same as in A. The goddess is not named and may be any one of a number of lioness-headed divinities of whom the most important is Sekhmet. Apparently the goddess is presenting the deceased to an assembly of the weird beings who people the Netherworld. Unfortunately, for the most part, their names are not recorded; instead, in every available space, Osiris, Lord of Eternity, etc. (various epithets) is called on ""to grant funerary offerings.""",N/A,11th-8th century BCE,"Funerary papyri like this one, containing potent magical images, were placed in tombs to enable the deceased to be reborn in the afterlife as a god. On the right side of the divided papyrus, the priest Djedkhonsuiufankh (pronounced ?jed-CON-su-yu-eff-ONK? and meaning ?the god Khonsu says he shall live?) raises his hands in adoration and offers burning incense to the god Osiris. Because he is a priest, his head is shaved and he wears immaculate white linen garments. Osiris appears in the form of a mummy; his black skin color refers to the fertile black Nile river mud with its promise of new life. Between them is a table heaped high with funerary offerings: loaves of bread, onions, a bunch of grapes, and three lotus flowers.
 
On the left, a lioness-headed goddess ushers Djedkhonsuiufankh into a shadowy world of gods and demons. The imagery depicts the sun god?s passage through the underworld at night, where he unites with the god Osiris to emerge again at dawn. By identifying with the sun god, the deceased for whom this papyrus was painted hoped to participate in the solar cycle of rebirth and achieve victory over death.",Funerary papyrus,N/A

On the left, two half-man, half-animal monsters battle each other while on the right a happy girl rides on a centaur.

Blue-and-white decor became universally popular with the Ottomans, however, and tile work in two shades of blue, such as the example shown here, was produced at Damascus in Syria beginning around 1500.

In adopting this approach,Bian creates images quite distinct from earlier masters with a dry ink technique that resembles nothing so much as charcoal drawings.

Wenchang is represented as a handsome man in the sitting posture. Sometimes he is also shown standing upon a fish, because the carp of the Yellow River is believed to make an ascent of the stream in the spring of each year, and those who succeed in passing the rapids of Longmen in Henan, become changed into dragons.

During the 17th century, in an attempt to establish French economic dominance in Europe, Louis XIV?s minister of commerce, Colbert, began a campaign to encourage the manufacture of luxury goods. Various incentives, including tax advantages, induced skilled artisans to move to France. Until this time Italy had been the premier silk-producing country. Silk cloth was expensive and popular with the European nobility; dominance in the silk trade represented large sums of money. As the French appeared to be taking over in the 1690s, the Italians made a last attempt to regain the market, creating the unique designs that today are called ?bizarre.? This aesthetic style with its large, asymmetrical, undulating patterns proved very popular and designers throughout Europe soon adapted the style.

The first NAC artist to work in this genre was a Gaigwa (Kiowa) artist named Silverhorn, born in 1861.  Archie Blackowl was another active member of the NAC, and many of his paintings were influenced by his experiences in the church's ceremonies.  Blackowl's paintings are unique because he was able to capture the emotion of worshippers by focusing on their facial expressions and body language.

In ""Prayer for the Mother,"" Blackowl paints the ceremonial setting in great detail, incorporating all of its essential elements.  The Roadman is the figure on the left who is holding the gourd rattle, feather fan, and staff.  Between the praying figures are the bucket of water, the water drum, the ceremonial fire, and the sacrament that sits on top of the earthen, crescent-shaped altar, which is painted in profile.  The Roadman's upward gaze and the pointed shape of the ceremonial fire directs the viewer to the focal point of the painting, the Waterbird, which doubles as a Crucifix and symbolizes the integration of Christianity and American Indian spirituality.

Calder's interest in printmaking began in earnest during this time, and though he returned permanently to America in 1933, his fascination with modernism and experimental art forms continued throughout his lifetime.

F?tes is a prose poem by French author Jacques Pr?vert honoring Calder's remarkable achievements as a modern artist. Pr?vert explained that Calder is a ""sorcerer?of happiness,"" one whose art is a ""pleasure of eyes and heart."" Pr?vert was struck by Calder's seemingly effortless process, in which spontaneity, originality, and pure freedom of expression made him unclassifiable. 
In preparing the illustrations for this project, Calder devised an unconventional technique for printing the brilliantly colored aquatints that accompany Pr?vert's text. Calder first made a preliminary drawing in color, and then cut sheet metal that had been prepared in aquatint to match the drawing. The various metal forms served as printing surfaces, which were laid out on a press and colors applied. The metal plates were then run through the press, transferring the color to the paper, while simultaneously embossing the sheet.

from a series of The Elements",Inscribed: [D.G.R.],19th century,"The attribution of this impressive stained glass design, along with its three companion drawings in Mia's collection (10.1-10.2, 10.4), has been a century-old puzzle. The large-scale cartoons, representing the four elements, were acquired in 1910 as the work of the famous British Pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-1882). This attribution was based on the spurious monogram ""D.G.R"" inscribed at the lower edge of each of the drawings. Over the years, other artists' names have been proposed--Frederic James Shields (1833-1911), Henry Holiday (1839-1927)--but no consensus among experts was found. 

Finally, in December 2015, exactly 105 years (almost to the day) after the drawings were given to the museum, the identity of the artist has been recovered. They are the work of the British artist Frederick G. Smith. It was Peter Cormack, the noted scholar of British and American stained glass, who tracked down the artist and also identified the project for which they were produced, the grand staircase at Avery Hill, in southeast London. Smith was a partner of the London firm Campbell, Smith, & Co., and he likely executed these cartoons between 1888 or 1889, when the house was being reconstructed by Colonel John T. North. The stained glass was completed by 1890, but  Avery Hill was badly damaged during the Blitz of World War II. In 1982 the museum acquired a stained glass panel directly related to the series, representing the allegory of Water (81.92). The provenance is not known, but the glass is roughly half the size of the drawing. It may have come from Avery Hill, or perhaps Campbell, Smith & Co. executed multiple versions of Smith's designs.","Fire, from the series The Four Elements","English, 1833 - 1911"

from a series of The Elements",Inscribed: [D.G.R.],19th century,"The attribution of this impressive stained glass design, along with its three companion drawings in Mia's collection (10.1-10.3), has been a century-old puzzle. The large-scale cartoons, representing the four elements, were acquired in 1910 as the work of the famous British Pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-1882). This attribution was based on the spurious monogram ""D.G.R"" inscribed at the lower edge of each of the drawings. Over the years, other artists' names have been proposed--Frederic James Shields (1833-1911), Henry Holiday (1839-1927)--but no consensus among experts was found. 

In December 2015, exactly 105 years after the drawings were given to the museum, the identity of the artist has been recovered. They are the work of the British artist Frederick G. Smith. It was Peter Cormack, the noted scholar of British and American stained glass, who tracked down Smith and also identified the project for which they were produced, the grand staircase at Avery Hill, in southeast London. Smith was a partner of the London firm Campbell, Smith, & Co., and he likely executed these cartoons between 1888 or 1889, when the house was being reconstructed by Colonel John T. North. The stained glass was completed by 1890, but  Avery Hill was badly damaged during the Blitz of World War II. In 1982 the museum acquired a stained glass panel directly related to the series, representing the allegory of Water (81.92). The provenance is not known, but the glass is roughly half the size of the drawing. It may have come from Avery Hill, or perhaps Campbell, Smith & Co. executed multiple versions of Smith's designs.","Water, from the series The Four Elements","English, 1833 - 1911"

Walking is one of four postures prescribed for meditational exercises in ancient Theravada Buddhist texts.  
Sukhothai artists were the first to create walking Buddha sculptures fully in the round. The type, however, has its roots in earlier images illustrating the Buddha descending from Tavatimsa heaven on a special ladder, after spending months there teaching his mother, who had died 7 days after his birth. It might also refer to the Buddha walking up and down a golden bridge in the third week following his Enlightenment.",Walking Buddha,N/A

She was a celebrated wit and had a penchant for political intrigue and scandal. In 1617 she married the notorious rake, James Hay, Earl of Carlisle, without her father's consent. She quickly involved herself in court circles, eventually becoming an intimate friend of Queen Henrietta Maria. After the death of her husband, she shifted her loyalty to the Republican party and was able to give its leaders important information concerning the royal family. Upon the restoration of Charles II, she conveniently switched her affections back to the Royalists, and tried to regain her position at court. But before she could make any marked progress in this direction, she died.

By the late eighteenth century, however, the printing process dramatically improved with the introduction of copperplate and roller printing techniques. 

With the change in technique came a corresponding evolution of patterns that often referenced neo-classical aesthetics and interest in classical antiquities. These highly sophisticated designs incorporated figures, architecture, and landscape, usually placed in small vignettes against a textured ground. In this piece, the designer Huet has appropriated elements from drawings by Louis-Fran?ois Cassas, made when he toured Egypt in 1784.

Here, Copley adapted his composition from a mezzotint after William Hogarth's painting of Frances, Lady Byron.

John Singleton Copley was the first great internationally renowned American painter. This work belongs to his most prolific period between 1762 and 1770, and coincides with the emergence of revolutionary ideas in Boston. Largely self-taught, he was the first full-time painter in the colonies. Excelling at capturing texture and surface details, Copley was also known for his uncompromising realism, giving the same meticulous attention to both psychological and formal details.

Because the rubber ball itself could injure or kill, significant resources were invested in equipment to protect against broken bones and damaged internal organs. Yokes made of perishable materials such as quilted cotton and wood have been preserved only in their depictions in paintings and sculptures. Stone yokes like this one were probably ceremonial representations, worn at opening and closing ceremonies, awarded as trophies, and placed in tombs. The imagery on this particularly finely carved example hints at the complex, multi-layered symbolism and religious beliefs embodied by the ballgame. At the closed end of the yoke is a human face peering out through the jaws of a supernatural creature that combines reptile, amphibian, and feline characteristics and lives at the entrance to the underworld.

The walls of the palace, constructed by Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BCE), were decorated with stone panels carved in low relief, narrating his hunting and military exploits.

This genius, or demi-god, was part of a grouping of winged creatures facing a stylized tree, a scene repeated numerous times in the palace. They appear to be performing fertility rites associated with the date palm, a tree held sacred by the Assyrians because it provides food, drink, wood and shelter. The cuneiform text which covers the surface is part of a standard inscription that extols the victories and greatness of Ashurnasirpal and describes the building of his palace. Traces remain of the bright colors with which the panel was painted, increasing its visual impact. 

The palace at Nimrud was excavated between 1845 and 1851 CE by Sir Austin H. Layard working on behalf of the British Museum.

Located in Normandy, M?nil-Hubert offered the artist a pleasant change of scenery and a family of captive yet willing models, whom he depicted on numerous occasions. This portrait of his host?s eldest child and only daughter, Hortense, ranks among the most memorable products of those visits and stands as the most winning depiction of a child from Degas?s long career.

The circumstances surrounding the portrait?s creation were documented in the 1930s during an interview with Hortense, then Madame Jacques Fourchy. She said that, having come to M?nil-Hubert in haste, Degas was without proper canvas and was given a remnant of mattress ticking as a substitute. This account was dismissed by later art historians as a faded anecdote. However, the accuracy of Hortense?s memory was substantiated in 1996 when a pattern of blue-and-white striping was discovered at the taped edges of the canvas.

The portrait remained in the Valpin?on family until 1930, when Hortense sold it to Wildenstein & Co., from whom The Minneapolis Institute of Arts acquired it in 1947.",Portrait of Mlle. Hortense Valpin?on,"French, 1834?1917"

Fundamentally a Kien was a basin for holding water, but it is more probable that this example was not a profane vessel, but a ritual one. A companion vessel, exactly like this one and with the same inscription, is in the Freer Gallery. The decor is desposed in three belts separated by bands of plait-pattern, each strand in the plait made up of a number of very thin threads. A similar plait appears on the foot rim. The neck rim is adorned with a narrow band of cowries. The top and bottom belts on the body carry interlaced dragons, the head of every second one being close to the lower margin, the intervening heads being close to the upper. In the broad central belt are t'ao-t'ieh heads, every second seen right as the vessel stands, the intervening ones seen from above. This intricate scheme of interlaced bodies is clearly to be seen in Karlgren, number 51, figures 53 and 54. The four stout handles have t'ao-t'ieh heads at the top. This creature, with broad rolled up nose and a protruding, hooked crest in place of the ancient forehead sheild, is very different from the early ogre head. A row of stylized cicadas adorns the front and sides of the handles, and there are interlaced dragons on the flat, movable rings suspended from two of the handles. The technical execution of these decor elements narrow bare borders to every band, the center filled with either spirals or volutes with triangles, is exceedingly close to that on vessels of the Li-yu find (Umehara, Etude, plates 1 ff.)

This decor detracts somewhat from the naturalistic treatment of the hooves and head of the buffalo. On each side of the cylinder (oval in section) is a creature, with human head but finlike hands and feet, lying prostrate on knees and elbows. The rump is adorned with a whorl circle, and another variety of the same motif (a number of round dots encirclinga central one) appears on the chignon. Along the back are tufts of the same kind as those commonly found on dragons; a similar tuft occurs in the bend of the knee. The curves of the body are reminiscent of those on Karlgren #8 (50.46.12). It has been suggested that the figure may represent a water demon. Patinagreen.",N/A,13th-12th century BCE,"The decor of this extraordinary object is executed in high relief and partly in the round.

In the Ming dynasty, soapstone became the preferred material of the literati. Scholars readily carved the soft material in their personal calligraphic styles. Like literati paintings, seals expressed the taste and personality of their owners. The squared, angular characters and simple, forceful calligraphy in these examples were inspired by Han dynasty (2nd century BCE?2nd century CE) script, which along with bronze inscriptions and other early styles of calligraphy was studied and emulated by the <i>wen ren</i>.

Apart from the t'ao-t'ieh on the tang, and the row of blades with rudimentary cicada filling near the edge of the axe, the decor is rather involved. This decor can best be understood through the aid of a parallel, an axe formerly in the Raphael collection, reproduced in Karlgren #85, figure 74. In this example the composition on the blade can be seen quite clearly. At the bottom there is a coiled snake, the head seen en face. Above is a figure that might be a demon. Nostril and mouth line have coalesced in a large, recumbent C, and from the head three large curling plumes sweep up onto the shaft tube.

Here, Renoir depicts the domes of the Cathedral of San Marco gleaming in the midday sun. This painting was left in a sketch-like state without any studio reworking. Executed in a typically Impressionist technique, the canvas is loosely covered with bold, hurriedly applied strokes of bright, unmixed colors. Simple daubs of paint depict the light falling across the church's fa?ade, as well as the people and fluttering pigeons on the piazza.","The Piazza San Marco, Venice","French, 1841-1919"

Instead of transferring a preconceived image developed in clay, wood, or drawings into the stone, the artistic process instead is seen as a dialogue between the sculptor and the stone, as a respectful interaction between the artist and nature. Metaphorically, the sculptor acts as a midwife who liberates the image enclosed in the stone, following hints of its shape, structure, color and texture. John Bernard Flannagan, who was born and raised in Fargo, North Dakota, studied at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts from 1916-1919. Later living in New York and Ireland, Flannagan became a champion of direct carving, a principle adopted by many modernist sculptors of the first half of the 20th century, especially in England.

When Rodin exhibited ""The Age of Bronze"" at the Salon des Beaux-Arts in 1877, it aroused great controversy. He had removed the figure's spear and retitled the work, causing viewers to question his subject matter.

Like much of his art, <i>Blind Man's Buff</i> is allusive and symbolic, inviting explication yet resisting explicit interpretation. Yet, the artist's use of the three-paneled format that was traditional to Medieval and Renaissance altarpieces evokes religious associations. Beckmann also drew upon classical sources, calling the figures at center ""the gods"" and the animal-headed man the ""minotaur."" Throughout the triptych, figures engage in sensual pleasures in a place where time, represented by a clock without XII or I, has no beginning or end.

[1] The work was likely removed from the Museum Folkwang during the confiscation of modern art from Germany's museums in the first two weeks of July, 1937 by the Nazis. There is a possibility that the work was removed slightly earlier, as Count Klaus von Baudissin, an SS officer who served a brief tenure as director of the Folkwang, had already ""cleared the museum of 'offensive' examples of modern art"" prior to Joseph Goebbels decree on June 30, 1937. (Stephanie Barron, ""Degenerate Art: The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany,"" 1991, p. 19)

[2] The work was sold to the German dealer Karl Buchholz in the degenerate art sales (see ""Entartete Kunst"" Inventory, no. 333 under ""Essen: Folkwang Museum""). 

[3] Curt Valentin worked for Buchholz's gallery until 1937, whereupon he then set up the Buchholz Gallery in New York in 1939. He received works from Karl Buchholz until the war broke out between the U.S. and Germany. It is very likely that Valentin purchased the work directly from Buchholz, but this has yet to be confirmed through archival documents.",Public Domain,G371,German Expressionism. Genre.

Modern and non-western arts were the means of their exploration?with study of the nude at the center of their practice.

Kirchner brings all these elements together in Modern Bohemia ?a depiction of his lodgings in Switzerland?to express the ideal creative environment. The forms of artist, author, nude, and female spectator are united with those of Caucasian carpets and sculptural objects inspired by tribal art in a complex balance of form, pattern and color. The artist's modulation of color intensity and placement of horizontal and vertical brushstrokes evoke a woven surface effect that firmly places this painting in what is known as Kirchner's ""tapestry"" period.",Modern Bohemia,"German, 1880?1938"

He painted six views of the seaport and its surrounding countryside. His intention was ""to translate as exactly as possible the luminosity of the open air, with all its nuances."" Although Seurat shared the Impressionists' goal of translating nature's light and color, he also wished to make Impressionism more precise. He wanted to replace its spontaneous, improvisational qualities with a more systematic, objective approach that could reflect the essential structures of a landscape, not just its transitory effects. To this end, Seurat developed an unusual new technique, variously called pointillism, divisionism, or Neo-Impressionism. He juxtaposed small dots of pigment according to his interpretation of scientific theories of color and optics. His followers, like Paul Signac, continued the pointillist style after Seurat's early death from pneumonia.",Port-en-Bessin,"French, 1859 - 1891"

His years of deprivation gave him stomach ulcers, so he abstained from meat and other rich foods. Beginning to achieve success as an artist, he found himself, ironically, buying meat?but not to eat. He expressed his ambivalent relationship to food through paintings of butchered animals.

Carcass of Beef shows the influence of Rembrandt?s Slaughtered Ox, a painting of an ox carcass strung up in a slaughterhouse. Soutine bought a steer?s carcass and put it up in his studio. As it rotted, his neighbors noticed the smell and called the health authorities, who suggested he inject the carcass with formaldehyde. He did so, but as the flesh dried it lost its vivid color. To solve the problem, Soutine bought blood from the slaughterhouse and applied it to the carcass.

Guston's contributions to public art during these years reflected his knowledge of Renaissance figurative painting and his interest in socially realistic subject matter. 

Today Guston is renowned for the highly original figurative art he created later in his career. However, he made a surprising and brilliant detour into abstraction during the 1950s. Long attracted to European painting of the 16th - 17th centuries, it was during a visit to Italy in the late 1940s that he immersed himself in the painterly work of the Baroque period. Studying its celebration of color, gesture, and movement, Guston felt that he could finally reconcile his interest in recognizable form with his impulse toward pure expression.  

Although we don't know for sure if Guston studied the paintings of Peter Paul Rubens, such as the one installed on the opposite wall, he most likely saw the European master's work while traveling in Europe. The similarities of color and structure between the Guston and Rubens paintings on view here are striking, as is their shared emphasis on movement, sensuality, and metamorphosis.

[1] The Molls were German friends of Matisse and acquired the painting directly from him, according to recollections of Georges Keller of Carstairs Gallery in a letter of May 12, 1950.

[2] Mr. Bernheim is listed as the owner of this painting on a label (affixed on the middle brace of the painting's stretcher) for an exhibition titled 'Exposition HENRI-MATISSE' at the Galerie Georges Petit, Paris. This would confirm the reference in letters from the McMillan archive file (letters, May 12 and June 26, 1950) which notes that this painting was at the ""great Matisse show held at the Galerie Georges Petit in Paris in 1931"" which, however, arrived too late to be in the catalogue.

Pietro Maria Borghese was Pope Paul V's grandnephew from Siena. He became not only an important cardinal in Rome but also the heir to the ecclesiastical titles, wealth, and extraordinary art collection of the great Cardinal Scipione Borghese.  Pietro Maria is shown wearing the habit of a cardinal. The silver inkwell decorated with an eagle and a dragon are symbols used by the Borghese family. 
Pietro da Cortona worked extensively in Rome for papal and aristocratic patrons, both as an architect and as a painter of grandiose fresco cycles. This is one of the rare remaining portraits from his hand. He probably painted it shortly after the death of Scipione Borghese (October, 1633) and Pietro Maria's own rise to prominence.

Nevertheless, he developed his own unique style and artistic vision. Through skillful use of ink wash and softly modeled forms, he imbued his paintings with great lyricism. This gentle and evocative view of nature depicts the transition from spring to summer. The plum, shown in the right screen, is emblematic of spring, because it is the first tree to send forth blossoms. The willow, with its long, trailing branches is associated with summer. Although integrated into an effective composition, other motifs carry long-standing symbolic connotations as well. Paired carp stand for marital fidelity as do herons, both believed to mate for life. Swallows, which busily gather material for nests, stand for domesticity and fecundity.","Willow, Egrets in Plum and Willow [left]","Japanese, 1504 - 1589"

He reportedly threw his sister off a rooftop, sent his brother to jail, and nearly murdered his nephew in a fistfight. Yet he produced religious pictures of stunning grandeur and inspiration.  

The subject is the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin, which represents the conception of Mary herself, and the belief she was born without sin. Castiglione follows the standard iconography, depicting the Virgin as Queen of Heaven standing among angels upon a crescent moon, a symbol of chastity. The doctrine, much debated in the period, was supported by the Franciscans, thus the appearance of two Franciscan saints kneeling before the Virgin: Francis of Assisi, on the left, and Anthony of Padua on the right.  

One of the few documented paintings in Castiglione?s career, the work was executed for the high altar of the new Capuchin church in Osimo, a small town in central Italy. The bishop of Osimo, Cardinal Girolamo Verospi, arranged the commission in Rome at the expense of Pier Filippo Fiorenzi, archdeacon of the church, whose family coat of arms appears at lower left. It was completed in October 1650 just weeks before the artist and his brother mysteriously fled Rome for Genoa. The reasons for their abrupt move are not known, but they were in a hurry as they left all of their belongings behind, including, according to records, their underwear.

The painting was designed to lend a sense of grandeur to these architectural ruins, creating a setting more theatrical than pastoral.
To make the scene more believable, Codazzi wanted to add figures, called staffage. But he was untrained in figure painting, so he hired another artist, Michelangelo Cerquozzi, to complete the work.

After achieving reasonable success in Paris exhibiting controversial large-scale paintings of peasants at the Salons, Millet moved his growing family to the hamlet of Barbizon, joining an informal artists? colony whose members were drawn to the forest of Fontainebleau and its surroundings. Up the road was the village of Chailly-en-Bi?re, where people from the region traveled to be baptized, attend school, shop for food, and mail a letter. The bold technique of this pastel displays Millet?s remarkable originality, later admired by the Impressionists; the rigorous spatial structure reveals his firm academic training.

Martin Luther (a close associate of Cranach) led the Protestant Reformation challenging the Catholic Church, arguing that man could have a direct relationship with God without the need for a priest to intermediate. 

Cranach adapted familiar Catholic imagery to the Protestant Reformation. The image of Mary as a half-figure with her son Jesus Christ as a little man standing on her lap is derived from Italian prototypes of the later 1400s. Jesus holds a single grape, which he has picked from a bunch held by his mother. This refers to the belief that bread and wine turn into Christ?s body and blood during Catholic mass, a doctrine shared by Martin Luther but disputed by other reformers.

Stella named the paintings after circular cities and archaeological sites in the Middle East, where he had traveled in 1963. <I>Tahkt-i-Sulayman</I> is an ancient shrine in Azerbaijan, Iran.

It was in New York that Wesselmann started to develop his own ""pop"" aestethtic. 

His first major series was titled ""The Great American Nude.""  For this series, Wesselman incorporated commonplace items with reclining female nudes and other nude figures. From this intense study of the human figure, his series Mouth was created. Mouth is a series of works that specifically detail the human mouth in a number of different poses---from open gapes to pursed lips holding a cigarette.

In the 1960s, Chuck Close photographed his subjects and then meticulously copied the photographic images, in paint, onto large canvases. With this painstaking technique, he preserved the objectivity of photography. Close also simulated the way the camera, like the human eye, focuses on one area at a time, leaving other areas blurred. By these means, he directed our attention to some intriguing aspects of visual perception.

A work of such grand scale--typical of American painting after 1950--is unsettling, particularly when it features a colossal human head. ""The large scale,"" Close explained, ""forces the viewer to read the surface of the painting differently...[to] look at it piece by piece.""

Verdier received from Le Brun major commissions for the Trianon at Versailles and Gobelins. After 1699, Verdier devoted himself to drawing and engraving. Verdier?s drawing of a kneeling woman, dating about 1677, is a study for a figure in a painting <i>The Raising of Lazarus</i> for the church of Notre-Dame, Paris. It epitomizes the manner dictated by the Royal Academy. Importance was attached to clear, distinct forms. Bold strokes of red chalk on tan paper define the contours of the figure.

When she refused to pay the agreed-upon price and insisted that the painting be removed from public view at the Paris Salon, the enraged Girodet sought revenge with this second, satirical portrait. Eighteenth-century artists sometimes portrayed people as mythological characters to highlight their virtues. Girodet inverted this convention to defame Miss Lange. Danae was one of the mortals loved by the Greek god Zeus, who transformed himself into a shower of gold and fell upon her. Girodet shows Miss Lange greedily catching the gold coins. All of the painting's details are scathingly symbolic. For example, the turkey wearing a wedding ring represents a man the actress married for his fortune.

The sphinxes? headdresses conceal candleholders, and the center drawer contains an assortment of illusionistic engravings, including Coaci?s trade card. The two doves can be made to kiss by means of a lever located under the fountain.

The battle of Ichinotani, on the right, illustrates Minamoto Yoshitsune's daring attack of the Taira camp. By leading his warriors in a mounted charge down a steep mountain at daybreak, Yoshitsune successfully took the Taira troops by surprise, forcing them to flee by ship. The left screen shows one of the most celebrated feats of martial skill in Japan's history. The Taira forces again fled by boat from the advancing Minamoto, shown here on the shore of Yashima.  At dusk, a young woman appeared on the deck of one of the Taira ships and proceeded to perform a taunting dance with a red fan decorated with a rising sun. Yoichi Munetaka, one of the Minamoto's best archers, rode his horse into the shallows and shot the fan from the woman's hand at a distance of some ninety feet. This amazing feat was seen as prophetic, and indeed, the Taira were completely defeated about a month later.

Ruscha 1970],20th century,"Ed Ruscha has always been fascinated with language. Inspired by Jasper Johns's austere numerals and targets, he set out to transform text and cultural icons into high art. In 1967, he began making his ""paper ribbon"" drawings, which characteristically feature isolated words as objects set in three-dimensional space. He portrayed his subjects in a precisely rendered trompe l'oeil manner, relying on various drawing mediums, cotton swabs, and the palm of his hand to draw the subtle tonal gradations needed to establish the highly illusionistic effects he desired. Rushca maintained that he chose words for their appearance, sound, or spelling rather than for their meanings, or referential associations. In 1984, however, the unmistakable reference to George Orwell's futuristic novel stands at odds with the graceful line and elegant form of the ribbon.

The present painting is an excellent example of the popularity during late Ming and early Qing for large, carefully rendered color landscapes that evoked the monumental mountainous landscapes of the earlier Five Dynasties and Northern Song period (ca. 10th-13th centuries). The wealthy Ming and Qing merchant class created a demand for large-scale, carefully delineated, decorative scrolls such as this for use in their luxurious estates. Paintings such as these, carefully rendered by skilled, professional artists for an affluent audience were substantially different from the smaller ink landscapes produced by the scholar-amateurs for the literati class with their emphasis on personal brushwork and literary content.","Landscape in the style of Yan Wengui, c. 1700",N/A

This painting illustrates a New Testament passage. A young maidservant accused the apostle Peter, in the yellow cloak, of knowing Jesus Christ. Fearing for his own safety, Peter denied the acquaintance. While working in Italy, the Dutch artist Gerrit van Honthorst earned the nickname ""Gerard of the Night"" for his dramatically lit night scenes. Like the Italian artist Caravaggio, whom he admired, Honthorst constructed psychologically intense paintings through the use of strong contrasts of light and shadow, close-ups of large plebeian figures, and expressive hand gestures.

This frame is an exceptionally fine and sophisticated example of the reverse profile cassetta style.

The home that Wright designed for the Littles was one of his last great Prairie School houses.  Characteristically long and low, with a hipped roof, the house featured windows spanning the entire lakeside elevation, giving the Littles full advantage of the impressive view.  Although Wright drew elaborate designs for these windows, Mr. Little did not want an intricate pattern to obscure his view of the lake.  As a compromise, large expanses of glass throughout the house have a central area of plain glass ""framed"" with an intricate border.  In this hallway, the framed area becomes increasingly complex in the design of the three right windows facing a grove of trees.By the late 1960s the large size of the house, rising property taxes, inflexible built-in furnishings, inadequate insulation, and many uninvited visitors placed the owners, at that time the Littles' daughter and her husband, in a difficult situation.  They made every effort to find a purchase, but no local buyer or institution could be found to save the house on the site.  A group of Wright enthusiasts contacted officials at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to see if they might be able to purchase it for installation.  The Metropolitan bought only the house in 1972, allowing the current owners to retain the property.  Portions of the interior were dismantled for future installation in the Metropolitan and for sale to other institutions.  The Minneapolis Institute of Arts purchased this hallway, which led to the master bedroom of the house.  It has been installed without its fourth wall of closets, allowing a broader view of the windows.  A model of the house is located directly across from the hallway.",Hallway window (left),"American, 1867?1959"

They went so far as to invent a new system of measures (the metric system), a new dress code, a new system of time (100-second minutes, 100-minute hours, 10-hour days), and a new calendar.

Rejecting the Gregorian calendar inherited from the Roman Catholic Church, which structured the very fabric of life around religious observances and feast days, the Republicans decided to mark the days in a more rational, secular way. Their new calendar maintained the twelve-month year but introduced three-week months and ten-day weeks (d?cades). The extended week was the least popular measure, and not just with the church. A day of rest every seven days, not ten, was sacred to the working class, too.

This study belongs to a series of designs by Louis Lafitte for a printed calendar in which he invented a new iconography for the months. The noble bathing woman represents Thermidor, France?s hottest month (late July to late August).

(Signature needs laboratory examination; it has been reinforced, is sunk, and obscured by discolored varnish.)",19th century,"Eug?ne Delacroix was the acknowledged master of the French Romantic school. In 1832, he traveled to North Africa with the French ambassador, Count de Mornay, who was to negotiate a treaty of friendship with the sultan of Morocco. One day in Tangier, the two hid in an attic and through the cracks of a shuttered window witnessed the frenzy of the A?ssaouas, a fanatical Muslim sect. The turmoil of that event is conveyed in this vividly colored and vigorously brushed depiction of the fanatics hurling themselves down the street. Of the pictures resulting from the Moroccan experiences, this remains one of Delacroix's most arresting.
