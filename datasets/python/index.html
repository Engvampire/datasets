Reported data and estimates are for activity taking place during the previous calendar month. The survey has been conducted monthly since 1964.

It is! the trick is that the "residential" and "nonresidential" categories are supposed to be below the "total construction" level, and the other categories are below those two categories.

This data collection is called the OSHA Data Initiative or ODI. The data provided is used by OSHA to calculate establishment specific injury and illness incidence rates. This searchable database contains a table with the name, address, industry, and associated Total Case Rate (TCR), Days Away, Restricted, and Transfer (DART) case rate, and the Days Away From Work (DAFWII) case rate for the establishments that provided OSHA with valid data for calendar years 2002 through 2011. This data has been sampled down from its original size to 4%. In addition, the original dataset only has data from a small portion of all private sector establishments in the United States (80,000 out of 7.5 million total establishments). Therefore, these data are not representative of all businesses and general conclusions pertaining to all US business should not be overdrawn. Data quality: While OSHA takes multiple steps to ensure the data collected is accurate, problems and errors invariably exist for a small percentage of establishments. OSHA does not believe the data for the establishments with the highest rates on this file are accurate in absolute terms. Efforts were made during the collection cycle to correct submission errors, however some remain unresolved. It would be a mistake to say establishments with the highest rates on this file are the 'most dangerous' or 'worst' establishments in the Nation. Rate Calculation: An incidence rate of injuries and illnesses is computed from the following formula: (Number of injuries and illnesses X 200,000) / Employee hours worked = Incidence rate. The Total Case Rate includes all cases recorded on the OSHA Form 300 (Column G + Column H + Column I + Column J). The Days Away/Restriced/Transfer includes cases recorded in Column H + Column I. The Days Away includes cases recorded in Column H. For further information on injury and illness incidence rates, please visit the Bureau of Labor Statistics' webpage at http://www.bls.gov/iif/osheval.htm State Participation: Not all state plan states participate in the ODI. The following states did not participate in the 2010 ODI (collection of CY 2009 data), establishment data is not available for these states: Alaska; Oregon; Puerto Rico; South Carolina; Washington; Wyoming.",

        'body': "The U.S. Supreme Court Database traces its history back about two decades ago, when Harold J. Spaeth asked the National Science Foundation to fund a database that would be so rich in content that multiple users - even those with vastly distinct projects and purposes in mind - could draw on it. Professor Spaeth's goal was at once refreshingly simple and extremely ambitious: to produce a database that would include and classify every single vote by a Supreme Court justice in all argued cases over a five-decade period. After securing the funding, Spaeth collected and coded the data, performed reliability checks, and eventually amassed the Database. In the late 1980s, he made it (and the documentation necessary to use it) publicly available. Since then, Professor Spaeth has not only updated it each term; he has also continued to perform reliability analyses, thereby ensuring its integrity with each release, and added new variables. Today's version of the Database houses 247 pieces of information for each case, roughly broken down into six categories: (1) identification variables (e.g., citations and docket numbers); (2) background variables (e.g., how the Court took jurisdiction, origin and source of the case, the reason the Court agreed to decide it); (3) chronological variables (e.g., the date of decision, term of Court, natural court); (4) substantive variables (e.g., legal provisions, issues, direction of decision); (5) outcome variables (e.g., disposition of the case, winning party, formal alteration of precedent, declaration of unconstitutionality); and (6) voting and opinion variables (e.g., how the individual justices voted, their opinions and interagreements). Case Centered data provides case level information; i.e., each row in the database corresponds to a dispute. These data do not contain specific justice vote information. A tremendously helpful resource for learning more about the dataset is the codebook: http://supremecourtdatabase.org/documentation.php?s=1.",
