Height and biomass were recorded at the end of the growing season. The growth of each genotype can be related to the habitat it was collected in, the temperature and precipitation of its homesite, whether it was collected in an agricultural habitat, and which genetic cluster the genotype belongs to. This dataset was created and published by Daniel Z. Atwater, U. Uzay Sezen, Valorie Goff, Wenqian Kong, Andrew H. Paterson and Jacob N. Barney. Their website is at https://weedeco.ppws.vt.edu/.",
