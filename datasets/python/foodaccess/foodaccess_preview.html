Most measures of how individuals and neighborhoods are able to access food are based on the following indicators: - Accessibility to sources of healthy food, as measured by distance to a store or by the number of stores in an area. - Individual-level resources that may affect accessibility, such as family income or vehicle availability. - Neighborhood-level indicators of resources, such as the average income of the neighborhood and the availability of public transportation.",
