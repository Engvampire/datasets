# CORGIS Dataset Project

The CORGIS Dataset project is a collection of really great, interesting, and situated datasets. These datasets are explicitly constructed to be easy for introductory computing students to pick up and use. In our own experiences, we have used these datasets for both small practice programming problems, and for large-scale self-directed projects for students.
